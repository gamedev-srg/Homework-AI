plush added a room to the scene with furniture made by ProBuilder!
For the player AI, I added the [Sabotager](https://github.com/gamedev-srg/Homework-AI/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/2-npc/Sabotager.cs) script, which allows (via the unity editor or in game) to change the behaviour of the enemy. For the mentioned behaviour I edited the [EnemyController3](https://github.com/gamedev-srg/Homework-AI/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/2-npc/EnemyController3.cs) file, where you can change the enemies behaviour.
using the [changeBehaviour](https://github.com/gamedev-srg/Homework-AI/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/2-npc/changeBehaviour.cs) file, which is applied to several GameObjects, you can change the behaviour of the enemy as required.
